 You stripped your love down to the wire
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
Broken arrows in the dark
Broken arrows in the dark
But I see you behind those tired eyes
But I, I see the hope in your heart
But I, I see the hope in your heart
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
Fire shy and cold alone outside
HohooI see the hope in your heart
I've seen the darkness in the light
I, I see the hope in your heart
I, I see the hope in your heart
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time
It's not too late, it's not too late
Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go
So take my hand, don't let go
Sometimes you're losing, sometimes shooting
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
To find someone you call home
We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
You stripped it right down to the wire
You'll find the light that leads home

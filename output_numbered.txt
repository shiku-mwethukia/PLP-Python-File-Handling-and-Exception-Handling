1.  You stripped your love down to the wire
2. Fire shy and cold alone outside
3. You stripped it right down to the wire
4. But I see you behind those tired eyes
5. Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
6. You'll find the light that leads home
7. Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
8. So take my hand, don't let go
9. Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
10. I, I see the hope in your heart
11. And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
12. Broken arrows in the dark
13. But I, I see the hope in your heart
14. I've seen the darkness in the light
15. The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
16. The only thing that's black and white
17. Is that you don't have to walk alone this time
18. We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
19. To find someone you call home
20. Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
21. So take my hand, don't let go
22. Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
23. I, I see the hope in your heart
24. And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
25. Broken arrows in the dark
26. But I, I see the hope in your heart
27. It's not too late, it's not too late
28. I see the hope in your heart
29. Sometimes you're losing, sometimes shooting
30. Broken arrows in the dark
31. Hohoo
